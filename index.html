            <strong>Blockchain defined:</strong> Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Why blockchain is important:</strong> Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.

          <p>
            <strong>What needs to change:</strong> Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Limited transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom line — and means we need a better way. Enter blockchain.

                <h3 class="sub-title">Greater trust</h3>
                <p>
                  With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are receiving accurate and timely data, and that your confidential blockchain records will be shared only with network members to whom you have specifically granted access.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h3 class="sub-title">Greater security</h3>
                <p>
                  Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                  <h3 class="sub-title">More efficiencies</h3>
                <p>
                  With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, time-wasting record reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — can be stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.

            <strong>
            There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or built by a consortium.
            </strong>
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Public blockchain networks</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These are important considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Private blockchain networks</h3>
          <p>
            A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Permissioned blockchain networks</h3>
          <p>
            Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Consortium blockchains</h3>
          <p>
            Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.

              <h3 class="sub-title">Blockchain in Money Transfer</h3>
              <p>
                Pioneered by Bitcoin, cryptocurrency transfer apps are exploding in popularity right now. Blockchain is especially popular in finance for the money and time it can save financial companies of all sizes.
              </p>
              <p>
                By eliminating bureaucratic red tape, making ledger systems real-time and reducing third-party fees, blockchain can save the largest banks lots of money.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="sub-title">Smart contracts</h3>
              <p>
                Smart contracts are like regular contracts except the rules of the contract are enforced in real-time on a blockchain, which eliminates the middleman and adds levels of accountability for all parties involved in a way not possible with traditional agreements. This saves businesses time and money, while also ensuring compliance from everyone involved. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Blockchain-based contracts are becoming more and more popular as sectors like government, healthcare and the real estate industry discover the benefits.

              <h3 class="sub-title">Personal identity security</h3>
              <p>
                According to AARP, up to 42 million Americans were victims of identity fraud in 2021 alone. Fraud on this scale can occur via everything from forged documents to hacking into personal files.
              </p>
              <p>
                By keeping social security numbers, birth certificates, birth dates and other sensitive information on a decentralized blockchain ledger, the government could see a drastic drop in identity theft claims.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="sub-title">Logistics</h3>
              <p>
                A major complaint in the shipping industry is the lack of communication and transparency due to the large number of logistics companies crowding the space. According to a joint study by Accenture and logistics giant DHL, there are more than 500,000 shipping companies in the US, causing data siloing and transparency issues. The report goes on to say blockchain can solve many of the problems plaguing logistics and supply chain management.
              </p>
              <p>
                The study argues that blockchain enables data transparency by revealing a single source of truth. By acknowledging data sources, blockchain can build greater trust within the industry. The technology can also make the logistics process leaner and more automated, potentially saving the industry billions of dollars a year. Blockchain is not only safe, but a cost-effective solution for the logistics industry.

              <h3 class="sub-title">NFTs</h3>
              <p>
                Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been the hottest blockchain application since cryptocurrency. The year 2021 brought a rise in these digital items that are currently taking the world by storm. NFTs are simply digital items, like music, art, GIFs and videos that are sold on a blockchain, ensuring that a sole owner can claim full rights to it. Thanks to blockchain technology, consumers can now claim sole ownership over some of the most desirable digital assets out there.
              </p>
              <p>
                Remember the 2011 meme Nyan Cat? That memorable GIF sold for $600,000 in ethereum on the blockchain. Before October, the digital artist “Beeple” never sold anything over $100. In March 2020, his digital work The First 5000 Days sold for an astounding $69 million. NFTs give buyers the chance to own digital moments, art, and culture that will outlive us all.

            <li>
              <h3 class="sub-title">Blockchain in Government</h3>
              <p>
                One of the most surprising applications for blockchain can be in the form of improving government. As mentioned previously, some state governments like Illinois are already using the technology to secure government documents, but blockchain can also improve bureaucratic efficiency, accountability and reduce massive financial burdens. Blockchain has the potential to cut through millions of hours of red tape every year, hold public officials accountable through smart contracts and provide transparency by recording a public record of all activity, according to the New York Times.
              </p>
              <p>
                Blockchain may also revolutionize our elections. Blockchain-based voting could improve civic engagement by providing a level of security and incorruptibility that allows voting to be done on mobile devices.

            We can code in pretty much any programming language. It can be implemented in C++, Python, Java and even JavaScript. 
            Let us take a look at a sample Python code:
            
            <code>
              </br></br>
              # A block is stored as a tuple of </br>
              # (parent_hash, transactions, hash_itself)</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              def get_parent_hash(block):</br>
                  return block[0]</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              def get_transactions(block):</br>
                  return block[1]</br>

</br>       </code>
            <code>
              def get_hash_itself(block):</br>
                  return block[2]</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # function to create a block in a blockchain</br>
              def create_block(transactions, parent_hash):</br>
                  hash_itself = hash((transactions, parent_hash))</br>
                  return (parent_hash, transactions, hash_itself)</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # function to create the genesis block</br>
              def create_genesis_block(transactions):</br>
                  return create_block(transactions, 0)</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # we create our genesis block</br>
              genesis_block = create_genesis_block("X paid $100 to Y")</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # print the hash of the genesis_block</br>
              genesis_block_hash = get_hash_itself(genesis_block)</br>
              print "genesis_block_hash:", genesis_block_hash</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # create another block</br>
              block1 = create_block("Y paid $20 to Z, X paid $10 to P", genesis_block_hash)</br>
</br>       </code>
            <code>
              # print the hash of block1</br>
              block1_hash = get_hash_itself(block1)</br>
              print "block1_hash:", block1_hash</br>

          <h3 class="sub-title">How does Blockchain work?</h3>
          <p>
            Initially, the node starts a transaction by signing it with a private key via cryptography.
            Once the transaction is validated it is included in blocks called the genesis block.
            The new block will become a part of the ledger. 
            whenever the new block is added, the transaction will be reconfirmed
            Six confirmations are required in a network to consider the transaction final.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">How Blockchain differs from traditional database?</h3>
          <p>
            The Primary Difference between Blockchain And Traditional database is 
            Architecture - Blockchain uses Distributed Ledger Technology whereas Database utilizes client-server architecture.
            Integrity - Blockchain Supports data integrity whereas, in the database, there is a possibility for malicious activity
            Transparency - Blockchain offers High Transparency Whereas in Database admin has the control.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">What’s the difference between blockchain and Bitcoin?</h3>
          <p>
            Bitcoin is an unregulated, digital currency. Bitcoin uses blockchain technology as its transaction ledger.
          </p>
          <h3 class="sub-title">Is Blockchain hackable or not hackable?</h3>
          <p>
            The codes in Blockchain will be embedded in Digital code and stored in a shared database that protects the data from deletion, tampering, and modification. Though Blockchain is a very influential technology, it is not entirely immune to attacks.
